# JavaDungeon

## Todo
* Driver run where all nodes are visited
* Driver run where a wrapping and non-wrapping dungeons are created
* Test cases to check if wrapping works as expected!
* Treasure that one method in its implementation!

IDEA - maybe count the number of arrows with the regular constructor to test differing interconnectedness.
