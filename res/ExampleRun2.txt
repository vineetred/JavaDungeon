File: ExampleRun1.txt

SUMMARY: We create a 5 x 6 (row x column) non-wrapping maze with an interconnectivity degree of 0, along with a treasure threshold
of 55%. Everything is generated randomly so these test runs might not be exactly the same each time
it is run! This run simulates a user navigating through the maze and picking treasure/arrows as they
 do so.

NOTE: The treasure/arrows generated in the driver run is pseudo-random without specifying any seed.
Hence, it most likely
will not match the treasure/arrows that you see in the example run text file. Please note that this
is a parameter that can
be specified to the default constructors.
